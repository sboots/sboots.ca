summary: "Beginning right around the time that Heather and I moved to Whitehorse, I noticed that almost all of the ads I saw on Twitter were from the same company. Anecdotally around 19 out of every 20 ads that I saw on Twitter were IBM ads, for more than a year. Below is a series of screenshots of these ads, collected between October 2019 and October 2020."

Online advertising is a fascinating thing. The layers of personalization and customization behind online ads (and the personal data that drives these) powers [a large chunk of the tech industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/facebook-apple-app-store.html). In ads on some social media platforms, sophisticated [math](/2020/10/19/interfaces-data-and-math/#math) generates [hundreds or thousands of variations of an ad](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-facebooks-ad-technology-helps-trump-win/606403/), learns which versions people look at or click on the most, and prioritizes those all automatically. 

In my case, I don’t experience a lot of advertising, online or not; living [in the Yukon](/2019/12/17/moving-to-the-yukon/) and not owning a TV, there aren’t a lot of ads that I see on a regular basis. (“Experience” might not be the right word, if you’re not a fan of ads; maybe “exposed to” as in radiation or “confronted by” as in a barrier to your destination are better verbs!) 

It’s an industry I find really interesting, and I’m a big fan of efforts to “reverse analyze” advertising (as everyday people on the receiving end of it). Paul Wells’ [#sawanad effort from Canadian political campaigns a few years back](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-conservatives-paid-and-earned-media/) is a neat crowd-sourced example of this.

When it comes to online ads, I don’t see a lot of them either; I use an adblocker browser extension ([uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), which I’d recommend enthusiastically to everyone [using Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) or [using Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)). Using adblockers eliminates practically all online ads and web tracking, [improves the security of your computer](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/16/108871/are-ad-blockers-needed-to-stay-safe-online/), and [speeds up your internet](https://www.raymond.cc/blog/10-ad-blocking-extensions-tested-for-best-performance/view-all/) considerably as a result.

The only exception – where I do see ads on a regular basis – is within the mobile apps on my phone, namely, Twitter, which (as you can guess!) I use a lot. There isn’t an easy way to block ads in native mobile apps, like Twitter or Instagram.

Beginning in October 2019, right around the time that Heather and I moved to Whitehorse, I noticed that **almost all of the ads I saw on Twitter were from the same company**. Namely, [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en), the information technology company that [frequently works](https://goc-spending.github.io/analysis/#aggregate-data-by-company) with the Canadian government. What was striking wasn’t the ads themselves, so much as the frequency – anecdotally around 19 out of every 20 ads that I saw on Twitter were IBM ads, for more than a year.

Below is a series of screenshots of these ads, collected between October 2019 and October 2020. It makes sense that I’m in the target demographic for these ads (given that I work in technology in the public service), and I wonder how much of an impact advertising like this has on government IT decisions. (In similar ways, I wonder how much of an impact the advertisements for defence contractors, shipbuilders, and payroll software makers on billboards in the Ottawa airport have!) None of this is a criticism of IBM or any of these companies, which are well within their rights to advertise their products and services. But it’s a question for public servants, of what influences we’re exposed to and how we respond to those.
