Let’s just say, it’s been a long time coming.

A lot has happened since I originally planned to start a blog. Years have gone by; I moved a few times. Andrew Coyne got [back on Twitter](https://twitter.com/acoyne)! 

The idea of writing things and publishing them on the internet has been appealing for a long time. I think it’s mostly because people I admire a lot – [David Eaves](https://eaves.ca/), [Sara Souidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/), [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/), [Mike Bracken](https://mikebracken.com/blog/), [Lucas Cherkewski](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/) – make a habit of doing that regularly. There’s some small fear that comes from that – on the one hand, living up to the standards set by heroes of mine. And on the other hand, putting down opinions of my own, that I know I will also eventually think are wrong, with the benefit of years of hindsight. Things on the internet last a very long time.

I think it’s worth it, mostly just to try it and see what happens. There are a lot of interesting conversations taking place every day – especially in my favourite niche topic, the intersection of technology and governments – and I’m excited to contribute small ideas to these conversations somehow. 

The subtitle on [David Eaves’ blog](https://eaves.ca/) is, “if writing is a muscle, this is my gym”. That’s an attitude I’d like to adopt here. Expect a lot of imperfect posts as I, er, exercise in public. I think I’ve been to a real-life gym once in my life, so …this should go well.

There’s a few people who I have to thank, for encouraging me to do this since longer than I can remember. [James](https://twitter.com/Shotgun_Jim), [Leon](https://twitter.com/Leon7G), [Alex](https://twitter.com/WhoisAlexFox), and [Brad](https://twitter.com/CongoGram) (my original Twitter friends!). [Kwabena](https://twitter.com/AfroKwabena) and [Delalorm](https://twitter.com/Delalorm), who led a phenomenal workshop on blogging at [Barcamp Kumasi](https://twitter.com/BarcampKumasi) in [2013](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bcksi%20%23blogging&src=typed_query&f=live). I promised I’d let you know when I started blogging – turns out I’m only 6 years or so late. The things I plan to write about here aren’t quite what I imagined they’d be then, but I’m excited about where they’ll go. And, thanks to [Heather](https://twitter.com/heathersem), as always, for a whole bunch of things.

Thanks for believing in me, years ahead of time. Here goes…!
