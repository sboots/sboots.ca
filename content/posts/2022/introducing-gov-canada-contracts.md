summary: "This week I’m coming up to the end of my Public Servant-in-Residence term at Carleton University. It’s been an absolute dream to work with Prof. Amanda Clarke and the School of Public Policy and Administration. A key focus of our research work over the past few months has been analyzing Government of Canada procurement contracts as a way of exploring how the federal government spends money on information technology. As part of this work, we’re excited to launch govcanadacontracts.ca, a research website that helps examine procurement trends across government."

(The answer is: [about $4.6 billion dollars](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/categories/information_technology/) in the most recent fiscal year.)

This week I’m coming up to the end of my [Public Servant-in-Residence term](/2022/03/16/joining-carleton-university-as-a-public-servant-in-residence/) at Carleton University. It’s been an absolute dream to work with [Prof. Amanda Clarke](https://amandaclarke.ca/) and the [School of Public Policy and Administration](https://carleton.ca/sppa/).

A key focus of our research work over the past few months has been [analyzing Government of Canada procurement contracts](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/) as a way of exploring how the federal government spends money on information technology. Conveniently, contracts for IT – and every other area of government purchasing – are listed in [a comprehensive open data set published on open.canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d8f85d91-7dec-4fd1-8055-483b77225d8b). It is a fascinating resource, and I’m a huge fan of the [open government team at TBS](https://open.canada.ca/en/about-open-government) that maintains this data.

As is often the case with government datasets – this information is publicly available (and you can even [search through it, contract by contract](https://search.open.canada.ca/en/ct/?sort=contract_value_f%20desc&page=1&search_text=)!) – but it can be hard to get an overall understanding of what the data looks like at a government-wide level. That’s particularly true in this case, with 925,000 entries in a 400MB CSV file. [Excel doesn’t cut it](/2022/03/05/things-id-like-to-see-in-upcoming-ec-collective-agreement-negotiations/#9-access-to-modern-tools-for-data-science-for-everyone), as the saying goes.

To make it easier to understand government contract spending at scale, [our team](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/about/) is really excited to launch **[govcanadacontracts.ca](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/)**, a research website that breaks down this data by vendor, by department, by category, and overall across government. You can explore [trends over the past few fiscal years](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/) across each of these dimensions, and use the links to jump from department to vendor to category and back – as well as look up the original source data for each vendor’s contracts with links back to the entries [on open.canada.ca](https://search.open.canada.ca/en/ct/?sort=contract_value_f%20desc&page=1&search_text=).

You can learn more about how the data was analyzed and how the website was built [on the Methodology page](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/methodology/). This research [expands on earlier work](https://goc-spending.github.io/) that some of you might remember from [Ottawa Civic Tech](http://ottawacivictech.ca/) – it’s been really wonderful to be able to revisit this from an academic standpoint. And to [conduct the analysis in R](https://github.com/goc-spending/contracts-data), not, uh, [PHP](https://github.com/GoC-Spending/goc-spending-laravel). (Long story!)

[Check out the website](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/), explore the data from your favourite government departments and contractors, and [let us know what you think](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHGzAQMaOkj4OD2Kc8Gw4ROChOfx6MKm5t2CSr6R4U2qupBQ/viewform)! If you see issues or errors, or if you have suggestions for data visualizations, website improvements, or future research, we’d [love to hear from you](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHGzAQMaOkj4OD2Kc8Gw4ROChOfx6MKm5t2CSr6R4U2qupBQ/viewform). 

I’m super grateful to [Prof. Amanda Clarke](https://amandaclarke.ca/), and to [Anne Lajoie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemichelelajoie/) and [Chantal Brousseau](https://chantalbrousseau.xyz/) from our research team. **We’ll have more to share in the weeks ahead from our research findings – stay tuned!** Amanda and I [will also be at FWD50 this year](https://next.fwd50.com/speakers) talking about our work and what the data tells us about the state of IT contracting in Canada – hope you can join!

Lastly: this kind of research would not be possible without all the work of R package developers and data science educators. You are all genuinely above and beyond – [thank you](https://govcanadacontracts.ca/about/). ❤️ Fellow Government of Canada folks: [modern data science](https://twitter.com/ToferC/status/1136729244464234497) isn’t possible without [the Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), the Python equivalent). [If it’s not available](https://isthisblockedinmydepartment.ca/) on your work computers, [it should be](/2022/03/05/things-id-like-to-see-in-upcoming-ec-collective-agreement-negotiations/#9-access-to-modern-tools-for-data-science-for-everyone). It is a wild and surreal set of game-changing data science tools, and [a phenomenal community](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) of practitioners.
