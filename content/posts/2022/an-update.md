Unfortunately, I wonâ€™t be able to present in-person at FWD50 next week. Prof. Amanda Clarke will cover the [AMA on government-vendor relations](https://www.fwd50.com/session/41/ama-the-state-of-government-vendor-relations) in my absence â€“ I hope you can all tune in for it (either virtually or in-person!)

The [FWD50 team](https://www.fwd50.com/about) is brilliant and Iâ€™m really grateful to have been invited to present. For those of you who are going in person, Iâ€™m so sorry to miss seeing you! For in-person and virtual folks alike, I hope itâ€™s a fantastic conference.

Iâ€™ll be tuning in to the virtual conference from here in Whitehorse, and cheering you all on in spirit. Take good care. ðŸ’–
