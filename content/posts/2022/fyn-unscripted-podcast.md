A few weeks ago I was part of the second English-language episode of the [FYN Unscripted podcast](https://linktr.ee/FYNRJFF), organized and run by the [Federal Youth Network](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/Federal_Youth_Network/Home). [Brittaney Lewis](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brittaney-lewis-12758a59) from DND hosted a conversation with [Sidra Mahmood](https://twitter.com/sidramatik) from ESDC and I. 

The topic for the episode was “[Building a reputation remotely](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qkKPlUUIz6DLnpuvh5PxS)”, and from there we dove into our early public service career experiences, finding friends across the public service and building a community, social media and [blogging as a public servant](/2020/01/21/principles-for-blogging-as-a-public-servant/), and our experiences working remotely and how this has contributed to our public service careers. And crying at work! And accidentally ending up in the news, and other adventures in the public service. 

All told it was a lot of fun, and a great reminder of how having a community of fellow public servants means so much.
