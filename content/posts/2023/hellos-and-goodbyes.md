This past week I started work with the [Government of Yukon](https://yukon.ca/), wrapping up almost seven years since rejoining the federal government and the team that became the [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca/).

In my new role, I’m the open government program manager within the Yukon government’s [eServices for Citizens branch](https://yukon.ca/en/blogs/digital-information-and-services). Part of my responsibilities will be the [Yukon open government portal](https://open.yukon.ca/), along with supporting a number of initiatives that the team has on the radar. eServices is a really outstanding and welcoming team; you can read about [what’s on the go in a team blog post from earlier this summer](https://yukon.ca/en/digital-blog/what-were-working-spring-2023). There’s a lot happening!

Open government and open data work is (as you can guess!) a topic [very near and dear to my heart](/2021/10/24/if-its-not-public-does-it-even-matter/), and I’m thrilled to be able to work on it [here in the territory](/2019/12/17/moving-to-the-yukon/).

It’s bittersweet to wrap up with the Canadian Digital Service; many of my closest friends and most inspiring colleagues are current or former CDSers. It’s also a pretty noteworthy time of transition for CDS as it [moves from its current parent department](https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=44023&lang=en) (the federal Treasury Board Secretariat) into [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html). Kathryn May has [a great write-up of what this could involve](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/august-2023/terry-beech-tall-order-service-delivery/), including some of the opportunities and pitfalls. It’s something that I’ll follow with a lot of interest and encouragement from the outside.

In the months ahead I’ll be reflecting more on the past several years in the federal public service, and I hope to pick up the pace of writing and blogging here! If you have ideas or suggestions on topics to write about, please [give me a shout](mailto:sean@theboots.ca) anytime.
