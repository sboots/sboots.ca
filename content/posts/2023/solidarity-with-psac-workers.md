_**Update:** As of May 1, 2023, [a tentative agreement was reached](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/psac-agreement-reached-treasury-board-1.6819491) between PSAC and TBS. You can [read more about the agreement on the PSAC website](https://workerscantwait.ca/tb-rat-faq/). On June 23, [the agreement was ratified by the federal government](https://psacunion.ca/government-ratifies-collective-agreements-for-155000-psac-members) after being previously ratified by members of each bargaining group._

Today the [Public Service Alliance of Canada](https://psacunion.ca/) (PSAC) [began strike activities](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/psac-strike-1.6813502). With more than 155,000 participating PSAC members, it’s [one of the largest strikes](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-2023/public-service-prepares-strike/) in Canadian history.

* PSAC’s [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://workerscantwait.ca/strike-faq/) provides details on the bargaining process and on strike activities
* TBS’s [Collective Bargaining page](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/collective-agreements/collective-bargaining.html) includes news on collective bargaining negotiations
* The [Canadian Association of Professional Employees](https://www.acep-cape.ca/en) (CAPE, my union as [an EC employee](/2022/03/05/things-id-like-to-see-in-upcoming-ec-collective-agreement-negotiations/)) has [a useful page outlining its members’ rights and obligations](https://www.acep-cape.ca/en/news/what-should-cape-members-do-during-another-groups-strike-action) when another union is striking (if you’re in another collective bargaining group, your union might have similar information available)
* The [r/CanadaPublicServants Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPublicServants/) is an excellent, unofficial resource for strike-related information (along with other discussion topics)
* Kathryn May’s [Policy Options newsletter](https://us7.campaign-archive.com/?u=f538f283d07ef7057a628bed8&id=e2c9500d72) is also an informative resource for public servants and the general public alike

I’m grateful that PSAC is advocating for [stronger remote work provisions](/2022/03/05/things-id-like-to-see-in-upcoming-ec-collective-agreement-negotiations/#permanent-remote-work-options-and-access-to-modern-tools) (which will ultimately make the federal public service [more effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPublicServants/comments/11l0xf6/comment/jbbaw94/) and [more representative](https://mastodon.social/@geekingirl/110284057411293595)), [alongside other important considerations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-federal-public-servants-bargaining-talks-public-service-alliance-of-canada-treasury-board-1.6809168) to support Indigenous employees and Veterans Affairs case workers. 

Public sector collective bargaining (although it’s often slow and cumbersome!) helps [raise the bar](https://jacobin.com/2023/04/canada-public-service-alliance-of-canada-strike-fair-wages) for workers’ wages and rights across the country. Strike action will likely be a challenging time for PSAC workers, but it makes a difference for all of us.
