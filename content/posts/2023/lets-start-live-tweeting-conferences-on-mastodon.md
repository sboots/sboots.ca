It‚Äôs been [almost a year since I stopped using Twitter](/2022/11/21/saying-goodbye-to-twitter/) on a regular basis. It was a big change given how large a role Twitter played in my professional life ‚Äì connecting with public servants across Canada and around the world and learning from their experiences. 

Now that it‚Äôs 2023 and X (formerly Twitter) is both [crumbling](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/6/23627875/twitter-outage-how-it-happened-engineer-api-shut-down) [apart](https://mas.to/@carnage4life/111303007717606751) and [morally suspect](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/05/the-moral-case-for-no-longer-engaging-with-elon-musk-s-x/717ce0e2-636e-11ee-b406-3ea724995806_story.html), **I think we should make [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) our new community**. Mastodon does what Twitter did, it‚Äôs less sketchy, and it‚Äôs part of a bigger community of federated apps that are new and exciting.

[FWD50](https://www.fwd50.com/) starts in a week and a bit (Canada‚Äôs go-to digital government conference), and if you‚Äôre attending in person or virtually, I‚Äôd love to see you on Mastodon!

Live-tweeting conferences has always been one of my favourite things ‚Äì a fun way to document highlights of the conference, and create spontaneous friendships with other people doing the same thing. A tiny kinship of online people ‚Äì and you‚Äôre all invited to be part of it.

If you‚Äôre new to Mastodon, that‚Äôs all good! Here‚Äôs an updated getting-started guide below.

## Getting started with Mastodon

### 1. Creating a Mastodon account

Unlike Twitter, Mastodon is a federation of thousands of servers. While on Twitter (and most social media) you sign up through a central registry, on Mastodon, you sign up on a server (or ‚Äúinstance‚Äù). 

For Canadian public servants, I‚Äôd recommend the [mstdn.ca](https://mstdn.ca/about) server; it‚Äôs run by a good team and has a lot of nice people on it. To sign up and create an account, you can go to [the mstdn.ca sign up page](https://mstdn.ca/auth/sign_up) and follow the steps from there.

Other good servers include [CoSocial.ca](https://cosocial.ca/about) (it‚Äôs a co-op, which is lovely!) and [ottawa.place](https://ottawa.place/about#about-this-server) (for public servants based in Ottawa). They‚Äôre also both run by great people.

### 2. Customizing your profile

When other users consider whether to follow you or interact with you, they may check to see if you have an image and a short bio with your account. It just helps people know who they are talking to.

### 3. Post!

Post interesting things and ideas! A couple tips on this ‚Äì it‚Äôs always nice to reply to people posting interesting things, to say thanks and tell them that they‚Äôre cool. And, if you post photos, it‚Äôs really important to [add alt text](https://mstdn.social/@feditips/107757781709598274) so that people with screenreaders and other assistive tech can tell what you‚Äôve shared.

### 4. Follow people and hashtags

You need to follow people _before_ you start seeing their posts, because of how Mastodon‚Äôs federation system works. It helps to follow lots of people, and then [create lists](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/network/#lists) to see updates from your friends and other favourite people. 

If you‚Äôre into government tech, some great people to follow are:

* [Dan Hon](https://dan.mastohon.com/@danhon) @danhon@dan.mastohon.com
* [Elizabeth Ayer](https://mastodon.social/@elizayer) @elizayer@mastodon.social
* [Waldo Jaquith](https://mastodon.social/@waldoj) @waldoj@mastodon.social
* [Dave Guarino](https://hachyderm.io/@allafarce) @allafarce@hachyderm.io

There‚Äôs also a [directory of civic tech folks](https://civictech.club/) and a (very extensive) [directory of academic researchers](https://github.com/nathanlesage/academics-on-mastodon) on Mastodon with interesting people to follow. [Fedi.tips](https://mstdn.social/@feditips) (@feditips@mstdn.social) is also a great account to follow and learn from.

Once you‚Äôve created an account and signed in, you can search for hashtags using the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù option or the ‚ÄúSearch or paste URL‚Äù text box. You can then [follow that hashtag](https://fedi.tips/how-do-i-follow-hashtags-on-mastodon-and-the-fediverse), which will start listening for future posts with it. **If you‚Äôre attending the FWD50 conference, start following the #fwd50 hashtag before the conference starts!**

That‚Äôs really all you need to know to get started!

## Let me know if I can help!

I‚Äôd love to see more Canadian public servants on Mastodon, from across government jurisdictions and from across the country. **If you‚Äôre a Canadian public servant and you‚Äôd like a hand getting set up on Mastodon, [send me an email](mailto:sean@theboots.ca?subject=Mastodon+setup)!** I‚Äôll help walk you through it. 

I‚Äôm excited to rebuild the community of awesome public servants that existed on Twitter, and I‚Äôd love for you to be part of it.

### Beyond the basics

Once you're up and running, here is some more information to enhance your experience.

* Your server moderators can have the biggest impact on your user experience. The moderator determines the rules of engagement and protects members from users that abuse the rules. You can move servers if you don't like its rules, but it‚Äôs easiest to just pick an instance you like off the bat.
* Moderators are usually volunteers. If you‚Äôre able to, it‚Äôs nice to donate regularly to help cover the costs of the server you use (mstdn.ca, for example, has a donation link [on its About page](https://mstdn.ca/about)). There‚Äôs no advertising on Mastodon and so the team running each instance pays for these costs out of pocket. (What‚Äôs a good amount? It‚Äôs up to you but if you‚Äôre also still unhappy about Twitter‚Äôs demise you can donate [$8 a month](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-twitter-will-charge-8-blue-tick-2022-11-01/) to your Mastodon server as slightly poetic justice.)

### Access

You can access Mastodon by logging into your server through your browser, or you can download an app. Mastodon is the name of the main [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/mastodon-for-iphone-and-ipad/id1571998974) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android&hl=en_CA&gl=US) apps, as well as the name of the platform. 

There are also several third-party apps that come highly recommended, depending on which device and operating system you use:

* [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) (for iOS and MacOS)
* [Tusky](https://tusky.app/) (for Android)
* [Elk](https://elk.zone/) (for Android and web)
* [Mona](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653?uo=4&mt=8) (for iOS and MacOS)
* [Mammoth](https://getmammoth.app/) (for iOS)
* [Ice Cubes](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) (for iOS)

You‚Äôll notice a theme with the names of these apps. üòú Mastodon is free, but some of the third-party apps have subscription or purchase fees since, again, there isn‚Äôt advertising on Mastodon or a single company behind it to fund these through ads and user tracking.

For most of these apps, it works best to create an account first through your web browser, then log in to the app and sign into your account. You can [pin the app to your device‚Äôs home screen](https://telegra.ph/How-to-add-a-Mastodon-website-to-your-Home-screen-as-an-app-on-Android-05-07) for easy access.

### Expanding your account profile

You can also [add links to other websites and social media profiles](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/) to your account profile. (Mastodon uses a neat setup for verification, which is optional but [worth checking out if you run your own website](https://joinmastodon.org/verification)!)

You can also [opt-in to Mastodon‚Äôs cross-server search functionality](https://fedi.tips/how-do-i-opt-into-or-out-of-full-text-search-on-mastodon/), if you‚Äôd like your posts to show up in search results. Or, you can leave things as default or [turn on additional privacy options](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/preferences/#posting).

_Let me know how things go! Big thanks to everyone who contributes to Mastodon‚Äôs [open source code](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) and [documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/), to the [Fedi.tips team](https://mstdn.social/@feditips), and to [everyone who shared feedback and edits to this draft post](https://mastodon.sboots.ca/@sboots/111297024796368674) on Mastodon. Rock on!_ üêò
