summary: "I’m really stoked to introduce “Vote YES Yukon”, a non-partisan campaign in support of electoral reform during the current Yukon territorial election. This year, the Yukon is having a plebiscite asking if the territory should adopt ranked voting, in place of the current system of first-past-the-post. I think it’s a great opportunity to show that change is possible – to improve politics in the Yukon, and also to be an inspiration to the rest of Canada."

I’m really stoked to introduce **[Vote YES Yukon](https://voteyesyukon.ca/)**, a non-partisan campaign in support of electoral reform during the current Yukon territorial election.

This year, the Yukon is having [a plebiscite](https://electionsyukon.ca/en/plebiscite) asking if the territory should adopt ranked voting, in place of the current system of first-past-the-post. I think it’s a great opportunity to show that change is possible – to improve politics in the Yukon, and also to be an inspiration to the rest of Canada.

I wrote a blog post in August in support of the plebiscite, and (as the saying goes) one thing led to another and here we are! 😄 You can [read the launch post for Vote YES Yukon here](https://voteyesyukon.ca/blog/introducing-vote-yes-yukon/),

> Electoral reform – improving how we vote and choose our political representatives – has been talked about for years. The electoral system we use across Canada today, “first-past-the-post”, has [a lot of downsides](https://sboots.ca/2025/08/20/in-support-of-the-yukon-electoral-reform-plebiscite/#what-s-happening) that lead to more polarization and more extreme political views.
> 
Here in the Yukon, a [citizens’ assembly of everyday Yukoners](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/) looked at how our electoral system could be improved. After a lot of discussion, the citizens’ assembly [landed on ranked voting](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/ycaer-final-report-october-2024/) as the best option for the Yukon.
> 
> In ranked voting, you choose your candidates in order of preference – 1, 2, 3 and so on – when you vote. It gives you more of a choice than just picking one option, and it encourages political candidates to appeal to a broader range of the Yukon population.
> 
> At the same time, ranked voting [keeps the local responsiveness and accountability](/#create-better-political-outcomes) of our current system. It’s a win-win!

I think the citizens’ assembly did a great job, and it’s fun to be able to champion their work. And, hopefully, see it translate into a lot of public support! The plebiscite is non-binding but if the results are positive, it could lead to eventually changing our territorial electoral system to ranked vote.

And, as a non-partisan public servant, it’s fun to be able to run a non-partisan political campaign! It doesn’t happen often. We have [lawn signs getting printed](https://voteyesyukon.ca/#support-the-vote-yes-yukon-campaign) and everything. (In classic public service style, yes, I filled out [a conflict of interest disclosure](https://yukon.ca/en/human-resource-policy-conflict-interest) to be doing this.)

If you live in the Yukon, [check out the different ways you can get involved in the campaign](https://voteyesyukon.ca/#support-the-vote-yes-yukon-campaign). And, thanks for considering voting YES to electoral reform! 🎉
